Use Unigram in a more comfortable and productive way. This addon provides many hotkeys for a quick and comfortable use of Unigram and makes a lot of small improvements.
## Some of the major improvements are:

* Adds a significant improvement to the display of messages such as a poll, a link, or a message with attached media.
* When focus enters the list of chats, it removes such phrases as: "chats, tab, selected list". And when the focus hits the list of messages, the phrase "list".
* The name and size of the file will be spoken when the cursor is focused on the "Open File" button or the "Download File" button, and when the cursor is focused on the play button of the audio file, you will hear its name and duration.
* When focus is placed on a voice message that is currently being played, first information about the time of its playback is announced, and then all other information.
* When the focus is on a message that contains information about a call, the duration of this call is announced.
* When focusing on a selected message in a chat, you will first hear the information that it is selected, and then the content of the message.
* Now, when moving in the chat, the phrase "Seen" will not be pronounced at all, and the phrase "Not seen" will be pronounced before the content of the message. This feature currently only works in English, Russian, Ukrainian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Croatian, Turkish, and Persian.
* Significantly improved the function of recording voice messages. Recording, sending and canceling the recording of a voice message are accompanied by characteristic sounds. Also, when performing these functions, the focus remains in its position and does not jump to either the record button or the message input field.
* If the media attached to the message is opened using the spacebar, then after closing it, the focus will return to the last element that was in focus.
* The add-on allows you to completely disable the announcement of progress bars, as well as disable only the announcement of the progress bar for playing voice messages.

## Custom sounds
UnigramPlus sound files are stored in the add-on's `appModules\media` folder. Open NVDA Settings > UnigramPlus and press **Open UnigramPlus sounds folder** to open it. To customize a sound, copy your replacement WAV file into that folder using the same file name as the sound you want to replace, then restart NVDA or reload add-ons. Add-on updates may restore bundled sounds, so keep a backup of your custom files.

## List of changes:

### Unreleased

* Moved the add-on's recurring background checks off NVDA's main loop, so chat
  navigation, typing and speech are no longer delayed by Unigram's UIA replies.
* Canceling a voice recording is now announced about a second and a half after
  it is stopped, instead of five seconds later.
* Fixed message-only shortcuts silently doing nothing on realized messages.
  Space to play, Enter to reply, Backspace to edit, ALT+C and ALT+D to return
  from the message field were all inactive on an affected message.
* Fixed message-only shortcuts silently doing nothing on messages whose UIA
  class is not readable, which is how a realized voice message can present
  itself. Space, Enter to reply, Backspace to edit, ALT+C and the arrow keys
  were all inactive on such a message.
* Fixed the space bar on music and file messages, whose play control is named
  Download rather than Button.
* Fixed the space bar playing voice messages and music again. Current Unigram
  exposes a message as a toggle button, so space selected the message, and the
  resulting state change made the add-on give up before pressing play.
* Fixed Ctrl+ALT+Left and Ctrl+ALT+Right stopping after the first press while
  the modifiers stay held.
* Fixed ALT+E for closing the audio player. It looked for the player through a
  ShuffleButton that current Unigram no longer has, so it always reported that
  nothing was playing; the close button is now found by its own icon.
* Fixed Ctrl+ALT+Left and Ctrl+ALT+Right for seeking through a voice message.
  The modifiers the user is still holding are now lifted around the arrow key,
  so Unigram receives the arrow instead of Ctrl+ALT+Arrow and ignoring it.
* Every behavior added after 5.4 can now be turned on or off in UnigramPlus
  settings: the voice message record button label, rich message text with ALT+C,
  the profile identity button label, the replying and editing announcement in the
  message field, the suppressed "list" announcement before messages, the live
  microphone and camera state during calls, and the unread count when switching
  chat folders. All of them keep their current behavior by default.

### Version 5.7.3

* NVDA+Alt+V displays the UnigramPlus version on a new line.

### Version 5.7.2

* NVDA+Alt+V now opens Unigram and UnigramPlus version information in a read-only, multiline window.

### Version 5.7.1

* Fixed Unigram 12.10.2 reaction buttons being treated as messages, so message navigation shortcuts no longer override their native Toggle action.

### Version 5.7.0

* Restored folder-switch announcements with a nonzero unread count while retaining the file-transfer progress tracker safeguards.
* Updated the shortcut lists from the current Unigram source and identified built-in shortcuts not yet listed in Unigram's official Shortcuts.md.

### Version 5.6.9

* Fixed an error that could occur when NVDA entered a secure desktop, such as a UAC prompt, while UnigramPlus background message tracking was enabled.
* Fixed Saved Messages topic rows in Unigram 12.10.1+ being treated as messages merely because their native summaries contain sent or received timestamps.

* Updated compatibility for NVDA 2026.2.
* Updated Polish and Burmese translations.

### Version 5.6.8

* Fixed Alt+C failing when WhatsApp Enhancer is installed due to an appModules helper module name collision.

### Version 5.6.6

* Added NVDA+Shift+V to announce the installed Unigram and UnigramPlus versions.

* Updated all translations and manuals for version 5.6.6.

### Version 5.6.5

* Fixed Enter for replying to messages and Alt+Shift+R for marking chats as read in current Unigram versions.
* Removed the web view mode and its setting; Alt+C now always opens message text in the original wx popup window.
* Updated all translations and manuals for version 5.6.5.

### Version 5.6.4

* Fixed Shift+Delete by using Unigram's native Delete command and automatically confirming deletion for both sides.
* Alt+2 now activates Unigram's Go to bottom button first; the duplicate Alt+End shortcut was removed.
* Added a setting to choose between the classic wx window (default) and web view when displaying message text with Alt+C.
* Unigram's official rich-message text is now used, with a temporary fix for unlabeled inline buttons in Unigram 12.9.
* Updated the shortcut list from the official Unigram 12.9 documentation.
* Added a temporary fix so Saved Messages topic rows announce the visible chat title instead of a TDLib type name.

### Version 5.6.3

* Fixed an intermittent issue where NVDA announced "list" before a message while navigating with the Up and Down Arrow keys.
* Added a setting for the Alt+[ behavior that announces message headers after their content; it is disabled by default.

### Version 5.6.2

* Fixed Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right so they seek the current voice message playback again.
* Fixed Alt+I so it moves to Unigram's inline chat search results list.
* Added Alt+[ to announce message headers after the content, so file names can be announced before sender names in profile media sections.

* When Unigram opens, focus now moves automatically to the chat list.
* Added Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down to move through chats with unread mentions.

### Version 5.6.0

* Fixed rich-message detection so sticker and emoji messages are no longer incorrectly announced as rich messages.
* Ctrl+R now uses Unigram's native voice-message recording and sending behavior while retaining UnigramPlus recording start and end notifications.
* Updated localizations.

* Added support for rich messages. Rich messages are announced when focused and can be opened with Alt+C in a browseable window.
* Links and mixed content are preserved, and links can be activated from the browseable window.

### Version 5.5.8

* Fixed automatic updates: releases are now retrieved securely from GitHub and the downloaded add-on is validated before installation.

* Restored compatibility with Unigram 12.7, where several shortcuts and announcements had stopped working.
* Poll messages again announce the question and the answer options.
* The forum topic list again announces the last message preview.
* During a one-to-one call, the mute microphone (ALT+A), enable or disable camera (ALT+V) and end call (ALT+N) shortcuts work again.
* ALT+End again moves to the latest message in the chat.

### Version 5.5.7

* Reorganized the keyboard shortcuts section into categorized tables and combined Unigram and UnigramPlus shortcuts.
* When recording a voice or video message, NVDA now announces "Recording a voice message" or "Recording a video message" along with the elapsed time, instead of "Tn voice message".

### Version 5.5.6
* Fixed the identity button in a group or channel profile announcing "Identity root" when tabbing past the name; it now announces the chat name and member count.
* Ctrl+C is no longer handled twice: it copies the link when the focus is on a link, and otherwise lets Unigram copy the message.

### Version 5.5.5
* Replying to or editing a message is now announced in the message input field instead of the usual message prompt.
* Fixed the typing indicator sound sometimes continuing to play after the app was closed, after the other person stopped typing, or after leaving the chat; it now stops as soon as no one is typing in the open chat.
* Updated Burmese localization.

### Version 5.5.4

* Fixed unwanted announcements such as chat folder unread counts, for example "All 535". File transfer progress is now restricted to Unigram upload and download controls and is ignored outside Unigram windows.
* Fixed coexistence with the Telegram Desktop NVDA add-on by enabling UnigramPlus only when the running application is detected as Unigram.
* Added a button in UnigramPlus settings to open the bundled sounds folder, making it easier to replace sound files with custom WAV files that use the same names.
* Added an up-arrow option for the message edit field that moves focus to the last focused message.
* Rebuilt Traditional Chinese as zh_TW and added Simplified Chinese as zh_CN.

### Version 5.5.3

* Added automatic announcement of file upload and download progress. A new option "Only during upload and download" was added to the progress bar announcement setting and is now the default. The ALT+U hotkey now cycles between three states: off, only during upload/download, and announce all progress bars.
* Updated the readme and translations.

### Version 5.5.2

* Updated the readme and translations.
* Changed the typing indicator sound.

### Version 5.5.1

* Fixed the hotkey for navigating through the list of group topics (ALT+6). Now it correctly detects the topic list when a forum group is opened from the chat list.
* Added a typing indicator sound: a sound plays in a loop while the other side is typing inside a chat and stops when they finish. This feature is inspired by the corresponding feature in the Unigram JAWS script.

* A lot of outdated code has been removed.

* Added keyboard shortcuts for navigating to the next and previous search results in chat. By default, these functions are assigned to the ALT+K and ALT+J key combinations.

* Now, double-pressing the left arrow on a message will shift focus to the message that the current message is replying to.

### Version 4.6.0

* Added a keyboard shortcut to move focus to list of group threads. By default, this function is assigned to the ALT+6 combination. Please note that often when pressing the enter key on the group that we want to open, the list of threads may not be displayed and then it is necessary to set the focus on this group again and press the enter key. As a rule, after the second press, a list of threads is displayed, and after that we can press a key combination that will move the focus to this list.
* Now the ALT+2 combination moves the focus not only to the list with messages, but also to the open profile, to the open list of group threads, or to the open section with settings.
* Now in the UnigramPlus settings, you can disable the pronunciation of the phrases "Admin" and "Owner" on messages in groups.

* Now if a message was sent in response to another message, by pressing the left arrow key, you can hear the text of the message in response to which it was sent
* Added French localization
* Removed the ability to add reactions to messages with keyboard shortcuts, since I was unable to adapt this function to changes in the Unigram interface

### Version 4.4.0

* The function of announcing activity in chats has been added. By default, this function is activated by double-pressing the ALT+T combination. The function remains active only until NVDA is restarted.
* The function of automatic announcements of new messages in the chat has been added. By default, this function is activated by pressing ALT+L. The feature remains active only until NVDA is restarted. There may be stability issues if too many new messages quicly appear in the chat.
* Added a keyboard shortcut for the function of converting voice messages to text. By default, this function is assigned to the NVDA+ALT+R combination. Please note that in cases where the voice message is very long, then the conversion to text takes place in parts. That is, it may happen that when Unigramplus notifies you that the conversion is complete, only part of the voice message will actually be converted. And after a few seconds, this text will be added.
* Now, when navigating through the chat list, UnigramPlus reports information about premium accounts and verified accounts.

### Version 4.3.0

* Now UnigramPlus works correctly when several chats are open in different windows.
* Added keyboard shortcut to move focus to user profile area if it is open. The default gesture is alt+5.
* Fixed minor bugs.

### Version 4.4.0

* The mechanism for saving UnigramPlus settings has been significantly redesigned. Now the settings will not be stored in the NVDA config file, but will be stored in its own config file. This should solve the problem when users after an update or just suddenly UnigramPlus stopped working, due to problems accessing the NVDA config file. Unfortunately, users will have to re-configure UnigramPlus for themselves, as after installing this update, all settings will be reset.
* Fixed UnigramPlus compatibility issue with BluetoothAudio add-on.
* Now the information that the message is not selected will not be reported. If a message is selected, information about it will be announced before the message content.
* Now the order number of the elements in the chat will be announced if you have enabled the element position in the NVDA settings.
